This repository contains code, data, and results for an assessment of daily price of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) from **18 September 2014** to **9 April 2023**.

The goal of this project was to explore the progression of the cryptocurrencies in recent years and give explanations for certain changes. Analysing the market helped us facilitate the identification of investment opportunities and predict future trends that are not present in traditional markets.

This project utilised Microsoft Excel, Python, SQL and Tableau.
